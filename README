Bubble burst code

Completely based on work of
Erneux and Davis
Brenner and Gueyffier
Savva and Bush
Savva (thesis)

at this time.  Improvements to come incrementally, but for now
work is for self-education, in
1. how to formulate numerical models
2. how to write good code
3. how to use version control

Ultimate goal
is to simulate bubble bursting
(incorporate non-Newtonian rheology, spherical geometry, etc...)
to account for observations of bubble bursting in mud.
