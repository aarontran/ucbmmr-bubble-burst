Rough log of design, layouts for finite difference code
-------------------------------------------------------
8/11/2013 - wrote simple explicit code
Code is unstable: velocity EXPLODES after 2 iterations
at curvature derivative discontinuity (going from flat film to hemispherical cap)
and at tip edge

Things to fix: edge tracking (not hard) [DONE??]
implement staggered grid
some kind of versioning (lrn 2 git...)
IMPLICIT TIMESTEPPING
DISCONTINUITY ACCOUNTING FOR IN CURVATURE AND STUFF... ?!?!?!

Reformulate following Savva and Bush, I suppose (solve for f=h^2, adaptive meshing)

8/22/2013 - moved change log, notes to new plaintext file

Attempted to implement the initial film profile used in Savva's thesis (Appendix B)
Appears to work on first test.
But code blows up nonetheless.

Consider moving this code to Python...
